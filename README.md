Executed comprehensive protocol reverse engineering project focusing on UART, SPI, and firmware rehosting.
Configured and analyzed UART communications using logic analyzer with odd parity settings on Raspberry Pi Pico.
Successfully identified and captured SPI signals by mapping MISO, MOSI, CLK, and CS pins. Developed Python script for firmware 
rehosting, implementing memory mapping, register manipulation, and API hooking (_wrap_printf, scanf, sleep_ms). Created automated key-guessing 
mechanism to extract flags from binary files. Demonstrated expertise in hardware communication protocols, binary analysis, and embedded systems debugging.
